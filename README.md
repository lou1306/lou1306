Ciao! Hi! Salut! Tjena! Grüß Gott! 👋

- I'm a University Assistant at the [Cyber-Physical Systems group](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/orgs/e191-01) within [TU Wien](https://tuwien.ac.at) 🇦🇹🇪🇺
- I want to improve automated reasoning about the correctness of programs and systems ✅
- I also want to use this form of automated reasoning to investigate the emergence of collective behaviour in complex adaptive systems 🐜
- I am also interested in formal semantics of languages, concurrency, and process algebras 🌀
- As of late I have been working on verification and reactive synthesis, and messing with SMT and SAT solvers 👨‍💻
